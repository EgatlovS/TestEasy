# testeasy
API for an easy to use REST testing tool

It's all about one "Project-File".
Everything you will test is saved in it.

The API provides everything to let you save 
this file in Git-Repositorys or in SVN Repositorys or various 
other locations.

Various Formats for creating the file like JSON, XML, YAML and more
are provided so you nearly never need to add something by your own.
